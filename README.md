<img height="546" alt="image" src="media/v2.png" />

This repository contains assets for OpenArm v2 (above), Cell, v1 and v0.3 (below) simulation in MuJoCo.

## Usage

For the example using `uv`, install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/),
then choose one installation method:

For editable development, run from this repository's source checkout:

```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

As a dependency in another uv project:

```bash
uv add openarm-mujoco
source .venv/bin/activate
```

To try a release in a separate directory:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install openarm-mujoco
```

To test a specific wheel, replace the package name with its `.whl` file path.

Launch the OpenArm v2 Cell simulation:

```bash
openarm-mujoco-launch
```

Without White Sheet:

```bash
openarm-mujoco-launch --no-sheet
```

With Wall Collisions:

```bash
openarm-mujoco-launch --walls
```

For v1 Bimanual Model (from the source checkout):

```bash
openarm-mujoco-launch v1/scene.xml --keyframe home
```

## OpenArm MuJoCo Web

[OpenArm MuJoCo Web](web/README.md) runs these models right in the
browser (MuJoCo WASM + three.js, no installation): open
<https://enactic.github.io/openarm_mujoco/>, or serve the repository
root locally (`npm run serve` in `web/`) and open
<http://localhost:8080/>. Drive the arms by keyboard or sliders; see
[web/README.md](web/README.md) for details.

## Collision Visualization
- To view collision meshes, activate `Rendering`>`Model Elements`>`Convex Hull` and `Group Enable`>`Geom groups`>`Geom 3` in the left sidebar
- It may also help to hide the visual meshes by deselecting `Geom 2`
